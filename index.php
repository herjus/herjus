            <h1>Curriculum Vitae</h1>

            <p>I have experience with C# and PHP web development. <br><br>

            I am a hardworking, highly motivated, thorough and have good work structure and work ethics.<br><br>

            My main accomplishments are my PVT model based on Peng-Robinson, and simulation software for backtesting bitcoin trading strategies. I also developed an integrated wellbore model, which is using the PVT model. <br><br>

            In Sharp Code AS I worked on development of applications to be used for estimation of petroleum production volume using C#, .NET and Visual Studio.<br><br>

            After Sharp Code AS I worked in a non-paid collaboration with my old boss, developing simulations, and implemented real-time logic engine for a trading bot.<br><br>
